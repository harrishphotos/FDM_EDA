# Fare Prediction UI Implementation Guide

## Overview
A new interactive fare and tip prediction interface has been successfully integrated into the NYC Yellow Taxi Streamlit dashboard. This provides users with the ability to input trip details and receive real-time fare and tip predictions using trained machine learning models.

## What Was Added

### 1. **Sidebar Navigation**
- Added a radio button navigation in the sidebar with two options:
  - ðŸ“Š **Analytics Dashboard** (original EDA tabs)
  - ðŸŽ¯ **Fare Prediction** (new prediction interface)

### 2. **Prediction Page Features**

#### Input Fields
The prediction interface includes all required fields:
- **Pickup Location** - Dropdown with all 263 NYC taxi zones (Zone name + Borough)
- **Dropoff Location** - Dropdown with all 263 NYC taxi zones
- **Trip Distance (miles)** - Number input (0.1 to 100 miles)
- **Trip Duration (minutes)** - Number input (1 to 300 minutes)
- **Passenger Count** - Slider (1 to 6 passengers)
- **Pickup Hour** - Slider (0 to 23, 24-hour format)

#### Output Display
After clicking "ðŸ”® Predict Fare & Tip", users see:
- **Predicted Fare** - Base fare amount in USD
- **Tip Probability** - Likelihood of receiving a tip > $2
- **Expected Tip** - Estimated tip amount (15% average when tipped)

#### Trip Summary
Additional insights including:
- Route details (from/to zones, distance, duration)
- Financial estimates (base fare, tip, total, average speed)
- Model information and notes (expandable section)

### 3. **Technical Implementation**

#### New Functions Added
```python
def load_models()
```
- Loads `fare_model.pkl` and `tip_model.pkl`
- Uses `@st.cache_resource` for efficient loading
- Returns both models or None if unavailable

```python
def load_zone_lookup()
```
- Loads taxi zone reference data from `Docs/taxi_zone_lookup.csv`
- Provides zone names and boroughs for dropdowns
- Uses `@st.cache_data` for performance

```python
def tab_predictions(fare_model, tip_model, zones_df)
```
- Main prediction interface function
- Handles user inputs, model predictions, and result display
- Includes error handling and validation

#### Modified Functions
```python
def main()
```
- Added sidebar navigation using `st.sidebar.radio()`
- Conditionally renders either prediction page or analytics dashboard
- Maintains all original functionality when analytics dashboard is selected

## Design Consistency

The prediction interface follows the existing dashboard design:
- âœ… Uses emoji icons consistent with the original dashboard
- âœ… Maintains color scheme and layout patterns
- âœ… Uses st.columns() for responsive 2-column layouts
- âœ… Includes helpful tooltips on all input fields
- âœ… Professional metric displays with st.metric()
- âœ… Expandable sections for additional information

## Model Requirements

The prediction feature expects these files to exist:
- `fare_model.pkl` - Random Forest model for fare prediction
- `tip_model.pkl` - Random Forest classifier for tip probability
- Both models should be trained on these features:
  - `trip_distance`
  - `passenger_count`
  - `trip_duration_min`
  - `pickup_hour`

## Running the Application

### Start the Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
```

### Navigate to Prediction Page
1. Look for the sidebar on the left
2. Select "ðŸŽ¯ Fare Prediction"
3. Enter trip details
4. Click "ðŸ”® Predict Fare & Tip"

## Error Handling

The implementation includes:
- Model availability checks (shows error if models missing)
- Input validation (min/max constraints on all fields)
- Exception handling for predictions
- User-friendly error messages

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Possible additions:
- Save prediction history
- Compare multiple routes
- Export predictions to CSV
- Add more visualization (charts showing prediction confidence)
- Integration with real-time traffic data
- Historical comparison (how this trip compares to similar trips)

## Notes

- The prediction page is completely separate from the analytics dashboard
- No changes were made to existing analytics functionality
- Zone locations (PULocationID, DOLocationID) are stored but not directly shown to users
- The interface shows human-readable zone names instead of IDs
- All existing features remain intact and functional
