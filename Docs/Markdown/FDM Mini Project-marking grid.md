| **1. Problem definition Business goals Data mining functionality : [20%]** | Missing or demonstrates little or no understanding | Many important points missing or poorly described. | Some incorrect interpretations coresponds to the requirements of the given scenario | Most important points of the scenario has considerd. | Bussiness goals and funtionalities have identified but no clear explanation | Bussiness goals and funtionalities have identified and explanation in detail. Justification of model compared with alternatives from the Individual Assignment. | Bussiness goals and funtionalities have identified and explanation in detail. Justification include. | All the requirements set in the range (80-89) satisfied plus provision of alternative solutions with appropriate explanation for the provision of these solutions. This range of grades shows that the student examined the tasks in a more-in-depth manner and provided more work than what the assignment was asking for. A fully perfect documentation. | |
| **2.Data selection, preparation, and preprocessing. [Weight: 20%]** | Missing or demonstrates little or no understanding | Many important points missing or poorly described. Incorrect use of some techniques. | Some important methods applyied. Some correct use of them. | Most important methods have applyied with minor corrects. | Even more important methods have applyied with minor corrects. .more sensible and adequate methods shown. | Very well planed techniqes and methods have applyied. Very good. Justification include. | Perfect use of techniques and methods. Justifications are presented. Alternative techiniques discussed. | All the requirements set in the range (80-89) satisfied plus provision of alternative solutions with appropriate explanation for the provision of these solutions. This range of grades shows that the student examined the tasks in a more-in-depth manner and provided more work than what the assignment was asking for. | |
| **3. Building and evaluating models. [20%]** | Missing or demonstrates little or no understanding. | Some attempt, but badly flawed. | Implementation of a basic model, and some results. No clear explanation. | Implemented a model, and received some results and explanation them. | Implemented a model and finetuned it to take good results and explanation them clearly | Very well planed and implemented model and fine-tuned it to take good results and explanation them clearly including justifications. | Perfect solution. Has fine-tuned. Justifications are presented. Alternative techiniques discussed. | All the requirements set in the range (80-89) satisfied plus provision of alternative solutions with appropriate explanation for the provision of these solutions. This range of grades shows that the student examined the tasks in a more-in-depth manner and provided more work than what the assignment was asking for. | |
| **4. Deploying product. Provide a suitable client App [20%]** | Missing or demonstrates little or no understanding. | Some attempt, but badly flawed. | Implementation of a basic user interface, or a more comprehensive solution which may be notionally or semantically flawed. | Demonstrates a clear understanding of interface principles. May be some errors of application. | Demonstrates a comprehensive understanding. A correct solution within stated constraints which closely models the problem domain. | Demonstrates full understanding. A correct solution within stated constraints which models the problem domain. | A 'perfect' set of Interfaces demonstrating will full accuracy the data flow of the system. | All the requirements set in the range (80-89) satisfied plus provision of alternative solutions with appropriate explanation for the provision of these solutions. This range of grades shows that the student examined the tasks in a more-in-depth manner and provided more work than what the assignment was asking for. | |
| **5. Provide a documented explanation of your results and demostration. [20%]** | Missing or demonstrates little or no understanding. | Very basic documentation with presentation of few arguments that are not though elaborated properly. | A basic documentation in which there is presentation of few arguments with some basic elaboration of them. | A more comprehensive basic documentation in which there is presentation of more arguments than in the basic documentation (40-49) and more comprehensive basic elaboration of these arguments. | Clear arguments in the documentation presented. Maybe some errors in syntax and language. | A comprehensive documentation which closely approaches perfection. | A 'perfect' solution with all the necessary features. | All the requirements set in the range (80-89) satisfied plus provision of alternative solutions with appropriate explanation for the provision of these solutions. This range of grades shows that the student examined the tasks in a more-in-depth manner and provided more work than what the assignment was asking for. | |
