FDM Mini Project 2025

Final submission

Final Report, Software solution, 10-minute video presentation, source code

**1.Final report**

Please refer to the report template. Report's cover page should contain the video link, repository link (Ex: Github repo link which contains all the work of the project, including front end and back end work), and the software application's deployment link. The final report should include comprehensive documentation of the work carried out during the project. Images can be used to support the work as applicable.

**2.Video submission guidelines**

For the video creation, all members can take part in presenting background, business goals, usage of tools and technologies for implementation in brief (not necessarily code), challenges faced, and solutions for them, further implementation, and demonstration of your software solution. Hence, the video should mostly focus on the demonstration of your working software.

* As per instructions, you are free to use any technology for building your application. Since you are building a product for a real world problem, aiming for customer satisfaction, you can customize your product accordingly with the technologies you have used.

**3.Source code submission**

Students should upload only source code, excluding libraries for the project base. A .py file that includes all the code necessary to support all the team's work can be submitted to the submission link.

The final submission folder should therefore have the final report, source code/s in .py format, and the video presentation.

During the viva, your submission folders will be used; therefore, there can be no changes made after the deadline (6th of October, 12.00 am) that are to be presented during final evaluations.

Therefore, the submission folder should have the final report, source code/s, and video presentation. A submission for each team can be made by renaming the folder,

`<Batch_sub_group_leader 's_IT_number> (ex: Y3.S1.DS.01.01_IT23XXXXX)` for easy identification.

**Viva session**

The final viva will be conducted as usual, individually from each member, to test understanding of the project's steps. You should have a proper understanding of the whole project, according to the techniques you have used, be it data mining/machine learning, etc.

Each member should have an in-depth idea and understanding on the dataset, data preprocessing steps, data transformation, model selection and development, backend and frontend integration, front end development and the final deployment of the complete software solution with necessary refinements and integrations.
