**FDM Mini Project - 2025**

**Due date:** 6th of October, 12.00 am

**Type:** Group work (4 members)

**Deliverables:**
- SOW, Final Report, Software solution, 10 min video presentation

**Evaluation:** Based on demonstration, viva, and reports

**Weight for the final grade:** 25 %

**Step 1**
Register your project with the given link on the subject page on or before the 22nd of August.

**Step 2**
Find out a real-world problem (use publicly available datasets) and propose solutions using Data Mining / Machine Learning techniques.

Before working on the project, make sure to show the datasets that you have selected to your lab instructor/lecturer by the next week (week starting from 25th August), to get the approval to continue your project during your allocated lab sessions. Please get the finalized decision for the dataset selection at least by the 7th of September.

After getting the approval for the topic and dataset, the team should submit the statement of work (SOW) document. It should include the following,
- Background
- Scope of work
- Activities
- Approach
- Deliverables
- Project Plan & Timeline
- Assumptions
- Project team, roles, and responsibilities

**Step 3**
Plan for final submission as described above.

*   When selecting datasets, ensure that they comprise at least **10,000 rows** with recent data and can be applied with **preprocessing**. It is recommended to identify backup datasets to mitigate any risks with your primary data source.

As per instructions, you are free to use any technology for building your application. Since you are building a product for a real world problem, aiming for customer satisfaction, you can customize your product accordingly with the technologies you have used.

The final viva evaluations will commence in the week starting from the 6th of October. The team leader should submit the final report, video, and the necessary source codes using notebooks by the 6th of October.
