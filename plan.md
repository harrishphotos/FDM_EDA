## Project Alignment Assessment

Your project shows **strong alignment** with the requirements (estimated **75-85%**). Here's the breakdown:

### ‚úÖ **Fully Aligned (Meeting Requirements)**

**1. Problem Definition & Business Goals [20%]** - STRONG
- ‚úÖ Clear client (NYC Taxi Drivers' Union)
- ‚úÖ Well-defined problem (data-driven insights for drivers)
- ‚úÖ Dataset approved (>100k rows from NYC TLC data, reduced to 97,139 after cleaning)
- ‚úÖ SOW document comprehensive

**2. Data Selection & Preprocessing [20%]** - STRONG
- ‚úÖ Stratified sampling implemented (`datasampling.py`)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive cleaning pipeline (`datacleaning.py`)
- ‚úÖ Quality assurance with verification (all checks PASS in `verification_report.md`)
- ‚úÖ Feature engineering (trip_duration_min, zone enrichment)
- ‚úÖ Documented cleaning rules and reports

**3. Building & Evaluating Models [20%]** - MODERATE
- ‚úÖ Two models created (`fare_model.pkl`, `tip_model.pkl`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Need to verify:** Model documentation, evaluation metrics (RMSE, F1-score, ROC-AUC), hyperparameter tuning evidence
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Need to verify:** Model interpretability (SHAP/feature importance) as mentioned in SOW

**4. Deploying Product [20%]** - MODERATE
- ‚úÖ Streamlit web application exists (`streamlit_app/app.py`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Need to verify:** Interactive prediction interface integration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Need to verify:** EDA visualizations embedded in dashboard
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing:** Evidence of model predictions accessible through UI

**5. Documentation [20%]** - PARTIAL
- ‚úÖ Cleaning reports, verification reports, data dictionary
- ‚úÖ README with project snapshot
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing:** Final project report
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing:** Video presentation (due Oct 6)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing:** User guide for web application

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Gaps to Address Before Submission**

1. **EDA Documentation** - Need comprehensive Jupyter notebook showing temporal, geospatial, financial analysis (mentioned in SOW but needs verification in `Data Engineering.ipynb`)

2. **Model Documentation** - Must document:
   - Baseline vs advanced model comparison
   - Performance metrics (RMSE for fare, F1/ROC-AUC for tips)
   - Feature importance/SHAP analysis

3. **Final Report** - Complete report following template with:
   - Video link, repo link, deployment link on cover
   - All sections from SOW

4. **Video Presentation** - 10-minute demo (not yet created)

5. **Source Code Packaging** - Consolidate all `.py` files for submission

### üìä **Scoring by Rubric Categories**

Based on the marking grid:
- **Problem definition**: 70-80% (clear but needs final report formalization)
- **Data preparation**: 80-89% (excellent work, well-documented)
- **Models**: 60-70% (models exist but documentation unclear)
- **Deployment**: 60-70% (app exists but prediction integration unclear)
- **Documentation**: 50-60% (technical docs good, final deliverables missing)

**Immediate Priority**: Verify the Jupyter notebook contains full EDA, confirm model prediction UI works, and prepare final report template.
