## Project Alignment Assessment

Your project shows **strong alignment** with the requirements (estimated **75-85%**). Here's the breakdown:

### ✅ **Fully Aligned (Meeting Requirements)**

**1. Problem Definition & Business Goals [20%]** - STRONG
- ✅ Clear client (NYC Taxi Drivers' Union)
- ✅ Well-defined problem (data-driven insights for drivers)
- ✅ Dataset approved (>100k rows from NYC TLC data, reduced to 97,139 after cleaning)
- ✅ SOW document comprehensive

**2. Data Selection & Preprocessing [20%]** - STRONG
- ✅ Stratified sampling implemented (`datasampling.py`)
- ✅ Comprehensive cleaning pipeline (`datacleaning.py`)
- ✅ Quality assurance with verification (all checks PASS in `verification_report.md`)
- ✅ Feature engineering (trip_duration_min, zone enrichment)
- ✅ Documented cleaning rules and reports

**3. Building & Evaluating Models [20%]** - MODERATE
- ✅ Two models created (`fare_model.pkl`, `tip_model.pkl`)
- ⚠️ **Need to verify:** Model documentation, evaluation metrics (RMSE, F1-score, ROC-AUC), hyperparameter tuning evidence
- ⚠️ **Need to verify:** Model interpretability (SHAP/feature importance) as mentioned in SOW

**4. Deploying Product [20%]** - STRONG
- ✅ Streamlit web application exists (`streamlit_app/app.py`)
- ✅ **Implemented:** Interactive prediction interface integration (sidebar navigation, input forms, model loading)
- ✅ EDA visualizations embedded in dashboard (comprehensive charts across multiple tabs)
- ✅ **Implemented:** Model predictions accessible through UI (dedicated prediction page with fare & tip estimates)

**5. Documentation [20%]** - PARTIAL
- ✅ Cleaning reports, verification reports, data dictionary
- ✅ README with project snapshot
- ⚠️ **Missing:** Final project report
- ⚠️ **Missing:** Video presentation (due Oct 6)
- ⚠️ **Missing:** User guide for web application

### ⚠️ **Critical Gaps to Address Before Submission**

1. **EDA Documentation** - Need comprehensive Jupyter notebook showing temporal, geospatial, financial analysis (mentioned in SOW but needs verification in `Data Engineering.ipynb`)

2. **Model Documentation** - Must document:
   - Baseline vs advanced model comparison
   - Performance metrics (RMSE for fare, F1/ROC-AUC for tips)
   - Feature importance/SHAP analysis

3. **Final Report** - Complete report following template with:
   - Video link, repo link, deployment link on cover
   - All sections from SOW

4. **Video Presentation** - 10-minute demo (not yet created)

5. **Source Code Packaging** - Consolidate all `.py` files for submission

### 📊 **Scoring by Rubric Categories**

Based on the marking grid:
- **Problem definition**: 70-80% (clear but needs final report formalization)
- **Data preparation**: 80-89% (excellent work, well-documented)
- **Models**: 60-70% (models exist but documentation unclear)
- **Deployment**: 75-85% (fully functional app with prediction interface and EDA dashboard)
- **Documentation**: 50-60% (technical docs good, final deliverables missing)

**Immediate Priority**: Verify the Jupyter notebook contains full EDA, confirm model prediction UI works, and prepare final report template.
